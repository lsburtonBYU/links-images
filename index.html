    <h1>Squirrels are our friends</h1>

    <article>
      <h2>Not what they seem</h2>
      <p>Have you spent your entire life afraid of squirrels? I know I have! I'm
        here to reassure you that squirrels are
        not evil vermin or government robot spies. Squirrels are our friends!
      </p>

      <p>Hopefully, this website will provide you with enough fact-based
        research to PROVE that we should never fear
        squirrels.</p>

      <h2>Government Friends</h2>
      <p>Squirrels spy on us? No, we spy on them. You can <a
          href="https://www.balmoralcastle.com/squirrel.htm">watch the live
          squirrel cam at Balmoral Castle</a> to see that if these creatures
        were evil, they would have taken over the United Kingdom by now. <em>Any
          rumors that squirrels are behind Scotland's break from the UK are
          absolutely false.</em></p>

    <h2>Tips for encounters</h2>
    <p>If you happen upon a squirrel, we recommend you take the following steps
      to ingratiate yourself with them:</p>

    <!-- the different list types were required for the previous assignment, but you
     can remove any if they don't fit with your website -->
    <ul>
      <li>Fill your pockets with nuts and/or roll smear peanut butter on your
        face (if you are allergic to peanuts, other nut butters such as almond
        or cashew are fine).</li>
      <li>Find a lone squirrel and slowly approach it</li>

      <li>Maintain eye contact with the squirrel at all times</li>
      <li>Hold a nut with both hands and nibble on it &ndash; <strong>this is
          key to squirrel friendship</strong></li>
      <li>Make loud clicking noise to assure the squirrel that you are an equal.
        You might want to practice these noises and the nibbling before you
        encounter a squirrel &ndash; <em>find our instructional videos on
          YouTube</em></li>

      <li>Once you are within two feet of the squirrel, yell, as loudly as
        possible, <strong>"Please be my friend!"</strong></li>
    </ul>
